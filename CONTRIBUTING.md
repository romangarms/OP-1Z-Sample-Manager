# Contribution Guidelines

Help on this project is always appreciated.

That said, we do have some guidelines.


## Creating issues

When creating issues, please fill out the template to the best of your ability. Some issues may not require every field, but please make sure your findings are expressed clearly.

- **Suggestions / missing features**: Explain in detail how you would like the feature to work and what problem it solves.
- **Bug reports**: Clearly describe the expected behavior and include steps to reproduce the bug so it can be tested.

## Assigning work

If there is an issue you would like to work on, we recommend leaving a comment describing your **intended approach** (not just an expression of interest). This helps maintainers quickly confirm that the plan aligns with the project’s vision and avoids duplicated effort.

For small, straightforward fixes (like those tagged `good first issue`), please skip the comment and open a pull request directly.
