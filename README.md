# OP-1Z Sample Manager

**NEW: OP-1 Support Added! New Features!** Sample manager supports OP-1, plus tape track exporter and backup/restore feature

This is a Flask app built to handle everything with samples on the OP-Z / OP-1. As time goes on, I'm adding more features around project management, export, and other various utilities.


### Run app using:
1) Have Python 3.9 - 3.14 installed. (3.13/3.14 suggested)
2) Install requirements in ```requirements.txt```.
3) ```python main.py``` **or** build with ```python build.py```, and run the created executable under ```dist/```.

### Using the App:
- Connect your device in disk mode and begin managing your samples, tapes, projects, and more!
